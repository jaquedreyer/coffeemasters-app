This Android app was built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.


---
The application was initially developed following the [Frontend Masters Course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/android-kotlin/). My goal is to implement future features and redesign the app using [Material 3 guidelines](https://m3.material.io/), to ensure a more robust and user-friendly experience. The app is currently in development. :construction:
